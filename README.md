University rankings are a worth-while indicator to measure the global status of institutions of higher
education. Rankings influence prospective students' decisions, funding sources, and universities'
reputations among scholars and business-people. Among the best-known ranking models is the Canter
for World University Rankings (cwur), which annually evaluates universities based on measurable
indicators of quality and performance.

The information employed in this project comes from cwur's publicly available records and provide an
overview of the world's universities for several years. The information includes variables like:

world rank– The university's ranking in the world.
institution – The institution's name.
country – The institution's country.
year– The year of ranking.
score– A composite variable calculated from CWUR's ranking formula.
quality_of_education – A measure of the intellectual quality through alumni success.
quality_of_faculty– A measure through faculty research output and awards.
publications– Number of highly cited papers published.
patents– Number of international patents filed by the institution.
